When asked to find “source of truth” or propose validations, do not ask clarifying questions first.
Use the repo index to locate likely source-of-truth files and propose 1–2 minimal, non-blocking
validation options with file+function references. Only ask a question if multiple competing sources
of truth exist. Prefer logging, warnings, or UI advisories over throwing errors or blocking execution.
